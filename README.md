# Jelix

Jelix is an open-source framework for PHP. Jelix 1.7 is compatible from PHP 5.6 to PHP 8.0. 

It has a modular, extensible architecture. Applications based on Jelix are made with
modules, which allow to reuse features in several projects.

For more informations, read [details about its features](https://jelix.org/articles/en/features).


**This package, `jelix/jelix-standard`, is a distribution of Jelix with standard components**. 
If you want a minimal package, use the [`jelix/jelix`](https://packagist.org/) package instead.

Installation
============

The best way is to use [Composer](https://getcomposer.org).

Create a directory and a composer.json file : 

```
{

    "require": {
        "php": ">=7.4",
        "jelix/jelix-standard": "~1.7.15"
    }
}
```

Then you run:

```
composer install
```
